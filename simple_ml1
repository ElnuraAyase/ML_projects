# Sample dataset: Fruit weight (in grams) and corresponding fruit type (0 for apple, 1 for orange)
X = [100, 150, 200, 250, 300]  # Fruit weights
y = [0, 0, 1, 1, 1]             # Fruit types (0: apple, 1: orange)

# Simple linear regression equation: y = mx + b
# For simplicity, we'll manually define slope (m) and intercept (b)
m = 0.01  # Slope
b = -1    # Intercept
